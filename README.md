# MIDI Remap

Every had a MIDI drum file that sounded good in one program and after importing into another one it started sounding 
weird or the wrong percussion elements were hit?

Same here, but there's a solution!\
With this tool you can build note mappings between programs/formats and convert MIDI files so they sound at leastÂ´
somewhat nice, wherever you need them to :)
